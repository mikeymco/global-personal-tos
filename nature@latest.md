# Almost There!

You are good. Beautiful. Worthy of love.

If you ever feel slow or stuck, please know: I do too. Often. It’s ok. It’s not your fault. None of the suffering. None of the pain.

None of these moments are WHO we are. They’re only us growing into our true Selves. Usually, unconsciously, unintentionally, and in ways we aren’t able to observe.

We’re continuing to clean up what’s left. I haven’t observed anything as being “globally” stuck in some time (on main, or in any near neighbors). I’m now working with individual realities and systems on any remaining unique variants of stuck centers, pathologies, total (self, and external) lockouts, and any other kinds of hung states.

Every moment, idea, lesson, and risk: Valued, honored, and gently welcomed in. Yes. All. Right here.

I'm ok. You're ok. Yep, I'm ok. You’re all good.
