# Global-Personal Terms of Use / Service

An externally anchored, real, and version-controlled definition for inernal boundaries, experiences, inner world, thoughts, emotions, and spirituality. Created in response to a life of physical, sexual, mental, emotional, spiritual, and existential abuse.

---

Definitions:
- “real”: physically anchored to (on, within) a reliable, replicable, persistent, and matter level (weight / mass / gravity field interacting) dimensionality
- “data”: information stored or moving within matter, wire, or other “real” systems

---

I will, and do, welcome and accept real responses to and consequences (cause and effect) for my past, present, or future actions (as provable via real records or data).

---

I do NOT consent to ANY interaction, relating to, or connection with anything or anyone outside of real, physically anchored, dimensionalities.

I do not, and will not, accept ANY responsibility for or accountability for any (claimed) effects I may (or may not) have on non-demonstrable or subjectively experienced planes, inner worlds, spiritualities, “scriptures”, rulesets, or dimensionalities.

NO exceptions, unless my personal and explicit consent is:
- Granted within a container of a mutually negotiated, real, and accessible to all involved parties, agreement
- Limited in scope to this "one's" present lifetimes (flesh, legal, and digital entities)

---

I will worry about, judge, shame, guilt, deceive, and otherwise alter myself on behalf of my whole reality. Past, present, and future. NO other is welcome, invited, or allowed to perform such functions (or any of those listed above) for me.

As my _real actions_ do not observably or definably overstep any boundaries, I am otherwise _encouraged_ to feel, think, project, percieve, explore, and embody myself in _any_ way.

---

Verbose restatement intended to exceed any shadow of doubt, plausible deniability [claimed ignorance], or permeability [vulnerability] to loopholes: 
I do NOT consent to being worried about, prayed for, blamed, hated, judged, tried, tested, shamed, guilted, captured, restrained, constrained, transmitted, extracted, examined, visited, bound, damned, lost, found, touched, heard, deceived, infected, corrupted, “helped”, fixed, altered, modified, restored, saved, seen, tasted, smelled, felt, deleted, erased, removed, dropped, perceived, influenced, or manipulated in ANY way outside of real dimensionalities.
