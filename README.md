# Global-Personal Terms of Use / Service

An external, real, and version-controlled definition for internal-external boundaries, expressions, and perceptions. Created in response to a life of physical, sexual, mental, emotional, spiritual, and existential abuse.

---

Definitions:
- “real”: physically anchored to (on, within) a reliable, replicable, persistent, and matter level (weight / mass / gravity field interacting) dimensionality
- “data”: information stored or moving within matter, wire, or other “real” systems

---

While my physical actions do not observably violate real boundaries, I am _encouraged_ to feel, think, project, percieve, explore, and embody myself in _any_ way.

I will, and do, humbly welcome the effects and consequences of my past, present, or future actions (as they are provable via real records or data).

---

I do not, and will not, accept ANY responsibility for or accountability regarding any (claimed) effects I may (or may not) have on the non-demonstrable or subjectively experienced planes of others (such as: inner worlds, spiritualities, “scriptures”, rulesets, moralities, etc).

WIP: I do NOT consent to ANY connections to or hosting of others internally except during physically anchored and real experiences of connection.

---

Verbose restatement of exclusionary boundary definition, specifically intended to empower unconscious, instant, invalidation and eradication of common psychological boundary violations:
- distorted projections
- undermining justified via plausible deniability or miscommunication
- permeability [vulnerability] to logical loopholes or narcisstic DDOS streams

I do NOT consent to being worried about, prayed for, blamed, hated, judged, tried, resented, rejected, repulsed, tested, shamed, guilted, captured, restrained, constrained, transmitted, extracted, examined, visited, bound, damned, lost, found, touched, heard, deceived, infected, corrupted, distorted, twisted, “helped”, fixed, altered, modified, restored, saved, rescued, corrected, punished, disciplined, farmed, harvested, milked, debased, rebased, seen, tasted, smelled, felt, deleted, erased, removed, dropped, perceived, influenced, or manipulated in ANY way outside of real dimensionalities.
