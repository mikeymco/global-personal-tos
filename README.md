# Global-Personal Terms of Use / Service

An externally anchored, real, and version-controlled definition for internal-external boundaries, expressions, and perceptions. Created in response to a life of physical, sexual, mental, emotional, spiritual, and existential abuse.

---

Definitions:
- “real”: physically anchored to (on, within) a reliable, replicable, persistent, and matter level (weight / mass / gravity field interacting) dimensionality
- “data”: information stored or moving within matter, wire, or other “real” systems

---

While my real actions do not observably violate real boundaries, I am _encouraged_ to feel, think, project, percieve, explore, and embody myself in _any_ way.

I will, and do, humbly welcome the effects and consequences for my past, present, or future actions (as they are provable via real records or data).

---

I do not, and will not, accept ANY responsibility for or accountability for any (claimed) effects I may (or may not) have on non-demonstrable or subjectively experienced planes (such as: inner worlds, spiritualities, “scriptures”, rulesets, or dimensionalities).

I do NOT consent to ANY interaction, relating to, or connection with anything or anyone outside of real, physically anchored, dimensionalities.

NO exceptions, except in the case my personal and explicit consent is:
- Granted within a mutually negotiated, real, and accessible to all involved parties, contract
- Limited in scope and duration to the relevant connection and moment

---

Verbose restatement of exclusionary boundary definition, specifically intended to empower unconscious, instant, invalidation and eradication of common psychological boundary violations:
- distorted projections
- undermining justified via plausible deniability or miscommunication
- permeability [vulnerability] to logical loopholes or narcisstic DDOS streams

I do NOT consent to being worried about, prayed for, blamed, hated, judged, tried, resented, rejected, repulsed, tested, shamed, guilted, captured, restrained, constrained, transmitted, extracted, examined, visited, bound, damned, lost, found, touched, heard, deceived, infected, corrupted, distorted, twisted, “helped”, fixed, altered, modified, restored, saved, rescued, corrected, punished, disciplined, farmed, harvested, milked, debased, rebased, seen, tasted, smelled, felt, deleted, erased, removed, dropped, perceived, influenced, or manipulated in ANY way outside of real dimensionalities.
