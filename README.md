# Global-Personal Terms of Use / Service [Contract, Negotiated Expectations, Public Accountability & Declaration]

[Soul, Definition, Public, Global, Open-Source, Opt-In, Blockchain, Matter Correlated]

An external definition and anchor for internal-external boundaries, expressions, and perceptions. Created in response to a life of physical, sexual, mental, emotional, spiritual, and existential abuse.

Personal note: I keep telling people, "I prefer text and voice messages (and other similarly verifiable) communication methods as I desire for myself _and_ others that everything I say, do, think, feel, and am to 'can and will be used against me'. This present first-pass, WIP, sloppy delaration and definition of boundaries is _knowingly and intentionally_ overextended and out of balance. My means of requesting, and now 'requiring' [subpoenaing, though without certified mail delivery, any and all who have and are overextended into my reality. ELI5: Tali is my innocence, I am my resolve. She has traversed and circumnavigated the outer limit of my reality and is now returning to me to assist in aligning BOTH SIDES of my, her, and _our_ boundaries. Yes. I am married to myself."

Definitions:
- “real”: physically anchored to (on, within) a reliable, replicable, persistent, and matter-connected dimensionality
- “data”: information stored or moving within “real” systems

---

I will, and do, welcome the resulting effects of my past and present actions (as they are demonstrably real).

While my physical actions do not observably violate real boundaries, I am _encouraged_ to feel, think, project, percieve, explore, and embody myself.

I will NOT, and do NOT, require the presence, permission, authorization, or authentication of any other for access to or expression of myself.

I will NOT, and do NOT, consent to ANY internal connection with or hosting of others within myself.

I will NOT, and do NOT, accept any responsibility or accountability for (claimed) effects I may (or may not) have on any other's non-demonstrable or subjectively experienced reality (such as: inner worlds, spiritualities, “scriptures”, rulesets, moralities, etc).

Verbose restatement of boundary definition, specifically using exclusionary language to empower unconscious, instant invalidation and eradication of common psychological boundary crossings:
- distorted or manipulative projections
- undermining justified as miscommunication [plausible deniability]
- permeability [vulnerability] to logical loopholes or narcisstic DDOS streams

I do NOT consent to being worried about, prayed for, blamed, hated, judged, tried, resented, rejected, repulsed, tested, shamed, guilted, captured, restrained, constrained, transmitted, extracted, examined, visited, bound, damned, lost, found, touched, heard, deceived, infected, corrupted, distorted, twisted, “helped”, fixed, altered, modified, restored, saved, rescued, corrected, punished, disciplined, farmed, harvested, milked, debased, rebased, seen, tasted, smelled, felt, deleted, erased, removed, dropped, perceived, influenced, or manipulated in ANY way outside of real dimensionalities.
