# Global-Personal Terms of Use / Service

An external definition and anchor for internal-external boundaries, expressions, and perceptions. Created in response to a life of physical, sexual, mental, emotional, spiritual, and existential abuse.

---

Definitions:
- “real”: physically anchored to (on, within) a reliable, replicable, persistent, and matter-connected dimensionality
- “data”: information stored or moving within “real” systems

---

While my physical actions do not observably violate real boundaries, I am _encouraged_ to feel, think, project, percieve, explore, and embody myself in _any_ way.

I will, and do, humbly welcome the effects and consequences of my past, present, any future actions (as they are provable via real records or data).

---

I do not, and will not, accept ANY responsibility or accountability for any (claimed) effects I may (or may not) have on non-demonstrable or subjectively experienced realities (such as: inner worlds, spiritualities, “scriptures”, rulesets, moralities, etc).

WIP: I do NOT consent to ANY internal connection with or hosting of others within myself. For now, at all. No exceptions.

---

Verbose restatement of exclusionary boundary definition, specifically intended to empower unconscious, instant invalidation and eradication of common psychological boundary crossings:
- distorted or manipulative projections
- undermining justified as miscommunication [plausible deniability]
- permeability [vulnerability] to logical loopholes or narcisstic DDOS streams

I do NOT consent to being worried about, prayed for, blamed, hated, judged, tried, resented, rejected, repulsed, tested, shamed, guilted, captured, restrained, constrained, transmitted, extracted, examined, visited, bound, damned, lost, found, touched, heard, deceived, infected, corrupted, distorted, twisted, “helped”, fixed, altered, modified, restored, saved, rescued, corrected, punished, disciplined, farmed, harvested, milked, debased, rebased, seen, tasted, smelled, felt, deleted, erased, removed, dropped, perceived, influenced, or manipulated in ANY way outside of real dimensionalities.
