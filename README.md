# Global-Personal Terms of Use / Service

An externally anchored, real, keystone and boundary definition for my subjective inernal experiences, inner world, thoughts, emotions, and spirituality. Created in response to a life of physical, sexual, mental, emotional, spiritual, and existential abuse.

---

Definitions:
- “real”: physically anchored to (on, within) a reliable, replicable, persistent, and matter level (weight / mass / gravity field interacting) dimensionality
- “data”: information stored or moving within matter, wire, or other “real” systems

---

I will, and do, welcome and except real consequences (cause and effect) for any of my past, present, or future actions (as provable via real records or data)

---

I do NOT consent to ANY interaction, relating to, or connection with anything or anyone outside of real dimensionalities.

Stated again, and with a level of specificity FAR beyond any shadow of doubt, vulnerability to plausible deniability [claimed ignorance], or permeability to other loopholes: 

I do NOT consent to being worried about, prayed for, blamed, hated, judged, tried, tested, shamed, guilted, captured, restrained, constrained, transmitted, extracted, examined, visited, bound, damned, lost, found, touched, heard, deceived, infected, corrupted, “helped”, fixed, altered, modified, restored, saved, seen, tasted, smelled, felt, deleted, erased, removed, dropped, perceived, influenced, or manipulated in ANY way outside of real dimensionalities.

I do not, and will not, accept ANY responsibility for, or be held accountable for, any (claimed) effects I may (or may not) have on non-demonstrable or subjectively experienced planes, inner worlds, spiritualities, “scriptures”, rulesets, or dimensionalities.

NO exceptions unless my personal explicit consent is:
- Limited in scope to this body’s present (flesh, legal, and digital body’s) lifetimes and domains
- Granted, experienced, remembered AND / OR documented, within the container of a mutually negotiated, real, and accessible to all parties, contract

---

I welcome interaction via real dimensionalities, systems, humans, and organisms. Otherwise, I will worry about, judge, shame, guilt, deceive, and otherwise alter myself enough for the whole of my reality. Past, present, and future. NO other is welcome, invited, or allowed to perform such functions (or any of those listed above) for me.
