# Global-Personal Terms of Use / Service

An external definition and anchor for internal-external boundaries, expressions, and perceptions. Created in response to a life of physical, sexual, mental, emotional, spiritual, and existential abuse.

---

Definitions:
- “real”: physically anchored to (on, within) a reliable, replicable, persistent, and matter-connected dimensionality
- “data”: information stored or moving within “real” systems

---

I will, and do, welcome the resulting effects of my past and present actions (as they are demonstrably real).

While my physical actions do not observably violate real boundaries, I am _encouraged_ to feel, think, project, percieve, explore, and embody myself.

I will NOT, and do NOT, require the presence, permission, authorization, or authentication of any other for access to or expression of myself.

I will NOT, and do NOT, consent to ANY internal connection with or hosting of others within myself.

I will NOT, and do NOT, accept any responsibility or accountability for (claimed) effects I may (or may not) have on any other's non-demonstrable or subjectively experienced reality (such as: inner worlds, spiritualities, “scriptures”, rulesets, moralities, etc).

Verbose restatement of boundary definition, specifically using exclusionary language to empower unconscious, instant invalidation and eradication of common psychological boundary crossings:
- distorted or manipulative projections
- undermining justified as miscommunication [plausible deniability]
- permeability [vulnerability] to logical loopholes or narcisstic DDOS streams

I do NOT consent to being worried about, prayed for, blamed, hated, judged, tried, resented, rejected, repulsed, tested, shamed, guilted, captured, restrained, constrained, transmitted, extracted, examined, visited, bound, damned, lost, found, touched, heard, deceived, infected, corrupted, distorted, twisted, “helped”, fixed, altered, modified, restored, saved, rescued, corrected, punished, disciplined, farmed, harvested, milked, debased, rebased, seen, tasted, smelled, felt, deleted, erased, removed, dropped, perceived, influenced, or manipulated in ANY way outside of real dimensionalities.
